    "result": "Terra from Vader: What’d that Beta Worlds tutorial video say again? “The ultimate post-apocalyptic theme park”? Fuck that. “Waste Land! Where Every Day is a Blast!” my ass. More like Zone designs so nasty they would make a cockroach think twice. And MOBs that redefine the term 'unfriendly locals.' This place is gnarly. What sick Architect thought it would be a blast to trudge through radioactive sewage sludge?\rElon Serene: You know, you're way too talented to be a Leftover. You would have made one hell of an Ad Buddy.\rTerra from Vader: Not having a Talent ain’t so bad. At least it gives me plenty of time to waste on you.\rElon Serene: Well, I’m loving the glowing sewer aesthetic.\rTerra from Vader: You couldn't even handle the carousel at the Carnival of Carnage. That Terror-Go-Round did a number on you. Doesn’t surprise me that our leisurely stroll through the bowels of Waste Land! is more your speed.\rElon Serene: I had to sit on that damned carousel for what felt like a cirxit solving that riddle so we could find this place. Ugh, I'm getting nauseous thinking about it. You're welcome, by the way.\rTerra from Vader: “With your entry, this riddle was solved. Claim your prize swiftly, lest your fortune devolves. Now awaits the true test of resolve.” Yeah, yeah. But who was it that scored us the day passes we needed - our ‘entry’ that came with the Sewer Scone sample vouchers? And let's not forget who won us these hazmat suits at the game booth, huh? I had that decontamination race down to an art.\rElon Serene: “Thanks, Elon, for finding the hidden entrance to the sewers under the Sewer Scones booth. Thanks, Elon, for putting in a good word for me with the Winners Circle. Thanks, Elon, for coming with me on this d-mezz mission to Fallout Fields so I can suck up to Guildleader mr_ir0nic.” See? Not that hard.\rTerra from Vader: Oh sure, all hail the mighty Gunter of the Winners Circle.\rElon Serene: Ha, very funny. You know, for a theme park where none of the bathrooms actually work, they sure did code an… elaborate sewer system in this Beta World.\rTerra from Vader: 'Labyrinth' is the word you are looking for. These sewers are a Puzzlemaster’s paradise. Platforms and walkways. Ropes, pulleys, and ladders. Hidden chambers and unexplored passages…\rElon Serene: Well, I guess we answered the question of why they were called Sewer Scones. I'm glad I didn't eat one.\rTerra from Vader: They were actually pretty good, all things considered.\rElon Serene: ….Do you…never mind.\rTerra from Vader: What?\rElon Serene: I can't shake off this feeling of being watched. It's like the shadows have eyes.\rTerra from Vader: Or this place was programmed to be uninviting.\rElon Serene: Or there are more Brokers out here looking for the same mysterious payload the Winners Circle has us searching for. That freaky cult, Shepherds of Whatever. The Wayfarer Bureau. They have the backing of the Paradigm Council, you know.\rTerra from Vader: And we’re in the fucking Winners Circle. As elite as they come. Don't start debugging out yet. We'll be fine.\rElon Serene: Hey! Look there, across the way. Those look like…glowing footprints…leading to that dark, creepy tunnel over there. You think that’s the way out of here?\rTerra from Vader: Yeah, anything that leads us to places we wouldn't want to go sounds about right.\rElon Serene: But uh, look down. Does the toxic sludge river seem to be getting more toxic sludge-y? I swear the sewage is getting higher by the minute, and I do not want to get d-mezzed. No way I’m coming back down here. Screw this mission.\rTerra from Vader: There's a ledge up ahead. We can use that to cross over it.\rElon Serene: Good eye. Looks like that tunnel is leading upwards. Hopefully, we’re almost out of this d-mezz trap.\rTerra from Vader: Honestly, I don't care where this leads, as long as it's away from this sewer.\r…\rTerra from Vader: I think we're getting closer.\rElon Serene: Not sure how you came to that conclusion. I can't see a thing in here.\rTerra from Vader: Exactly, I want out of this tunnel even more than I wanted out of the sewers. I’m manifesting our exit.\rElon Serene: Huh, is that what I think it is?\rTerra from Vader: If you're thinking it's a better situation than we're in right now…probably not. But if you're thinking it's the end of the tunnel…you’re probably right.\rLOCATION: Entrance to Fallout Fields Zone\rTerra from Vader: This place...there's a kind of twisted beauty to it.\rElon Serene: And it's probably just as twisted in danger too.\rTerra from Vader: Where are we headed exactly? I know the transmission from Guildleader mr_ir0nic said there have been rumors of some giant payload in Fallout Fields, but now that we are here, do we have a heading?\rElon Serene: Our instructions were pretty open-ended. We just know there have been massive spikes in radiation here, and we might need to crank up our rad-protection gear to make sure our rad meters don’t max out. Overall, Fallout Fields is one big question mark, so we should be ready for anything as we look for this payload.\rTerra from Vader: What even is this fucking payload?\rElon Serene: Beats me. But if we snag it, it's a one-way ticket to the top of the Winners Circle. So we’re going to find out, one way or another.\rTerra from Vader: Finding shelter would be a good start. The sky's telling me a rad storm's about to roll in. And these hazmat suits can only take so much radiation.\rElon Serene: Over there, you see that? There's a light in the distance. My Gunter’s gut is telling me to go there.\rTerra from Vader: You mean that eerie glow on the far side of the kilometer-long pit of doom?\rElon Serene: Exactly.\rTerra from Vader: Shouldn’t we avoid unidentified light sources?\rElon Serene: And miss a potential clue? We didn’t come all this way for nothing.\rTerra from Vader: Of course, there's a kilometer-long pit of doom. Where else would you install one?\rElon Serene: You muttering about something?\rTerra from Vader: Nope! Let's get a move on.\r…\rTerra from Vader: Catch sight of that?\rElon Serene: It's a bit hazy with all this smog, but seems like a metallic camper of sorts…glowing with that light.\rTerra from Vader: Always fancied a camping trip. Do you reckon it's abandoned?\rElon Serene: Doesn’t matter. We've got to hole up in there before this storm hits. If our rad meters max out, we’re dust. Instant d-mezz. But keep your guard up. Lights usually mean someone’s home.\rTerra from Vader: Well, we are about to lock ourselves in with whoever it is. The storm is here. Guess we should have timed our little Waste Land! vacation better.\rElon Serene: Quick, shut the door before that nasty smoke gets inside.\rTerra from Vader: It’s a mess in here. Look at all this dust. What is all this crap? Looks like a Hacker’s lab threw up in here.\rElon Serene: Walls have been scribbled on, too. Symbols...riddles…“Authority's echo does not always speak the truth”...What do you make of that? It's written all over the place.\rTerra from Vader: Hey Captain Enigma, seems like someone created a digital replica of Fallout Fields in this ‘gram. That's the storm, right over us. Not gonna pass anytime soon. If we're gonna continue this payload hunt, we’re going to have to brave that storm.\rElon Serene: We won't last a tix out there. Visibility will be zero, and Asherah-forbid we come across any MOBs.\rTerra from Vader: Wait a blox. Check this out. There's a path mapped out here, leading straight through the entire Zone to…hey, I think that’s the Waste Land! respawn node.\rElon Serene: I didn't see any signs of a path when we were-\rBANG BANG\rElon Serene: Uh oh, we’re about to have company.\rTerra from Vader: Should I put some coffee on?\rBANG\rElon Serene: Hold it right there. Don’t come any closer or we’ll send you straight to the respawn node. Identify yourself.\r???: You're the one party crashing my mobile command. Who are YOU?\rElon Serene: Let's start with you.\r???: How 'bout I ditch this tacky hazmat poncho and respirator first?\rTerra from Vader: Oh my fucking Asherah. No fucking way. Guildleader mr_ir0nic?\rUnironic Ken: In the digital flesh, babe. Didn't think I'd cross paths with another Broker reckless enough to head into this forsaken wasteland in the middle of a rad storm. That kind of crazy, you've gotta be Winners Circle, huh?\rElon Serene: Elon Serene, Gunter. And Terra from Vader, Leftover. Fresh Winners Circle recruits, ranking-\rTerra from Vader: You here looking for the payload too?\rUnironic Ken: Damn straight. Wouldn't feel right sending my Faction grunts to this hellscape and not getting my own hands dirty. Found this rundown camper a while back, and it's become my makeshift headquarters. But let me tell you, the previous occupant must have been a conspiracy theorist on a whole new level. See the walls? Total loony tunes stuff, if you ask me.\rElon Serene: Don’t want to intrude, Guildleader, but mind if we keep you company until this storm lets up?\rUnironic Ken: That might take a hot minute, sweetheart. What about I show you a trick or two instead? Been romping around Fallout Fields long enough to pick up a few survival hacks. Beneath this rust bucket on wheels, there's a tunnel system. It can get us moving while the storm is overhead. Let me show you something…oh, and call me Guildleader again and I’ll flood your Inventory with an endless stream of virtual cabbages. Call me Ken.\r…\rElon Serene: Any cirxit of the cycle, I'd take these tunnels to those sewers.\rUnironic Ken: Ah, you took the Gamma Gutters to get here, huh? Fastest route without fast-travel setup, but it sure as hell isn’t the prettiest. These tunnels here always pop up right when the radiation storms kick-off. Everything might move around on the surface after the storm, but the tunnel’s path seems hard-coded.\rTerra from Vader: What do you mean by “move around on the surface”?\rUnironic Ken: After the storm passes over, some stuff disappears. Some stuff appears. And sometimes things are just…different. That’s what makes it a prime spot to stash this payload our code-crackers unearthed. Ah, here's our first pit stop!\r???: Step right up up up. Step right up up up.\rElon Serene: What's that sound? And what is this place?\rUnironic Ken: It always gave me an underground military bunker vibe - kind of reminded me of what my friend said about Drifter bunkers…ah, forget it. A better question you should be asking is how did these pixel puppets get here?\rElon Serene: Are those…NPCs?\rUnironic Ken: As real as the code they're scripted from. None of them are meant to be in this Zone - I cross-checked with our Hackers. Yet here they are, milling around down here in some time loop. Same lines, over and over.\rCarnie NPC: Step right up, step right up! Try your luck, win a three-eyed teddy bear for your sweetheart! Step right up, step right up! Try your luck, win-\rSQUAAARK\rTerra from Vader: What the fuck is that?!\rUnironic Ken: Mutant Menagerie Zone. My bracer says it’s called an Atrotross. But the NPCs aren’t the biggest problem. Meet Ziva the Cooing.\rElon Serene: She’s…she’s a Broker!\rUnironic Ken: She's actually the main reason I’m here. She's part of the Winners Circle, headed out here a few cirxits ago, just like you two, in search of the payload. Then, out of the blue, we lost her signal. No trace on any of our channels. I got worried. Last time someone vanished without a trace...well, they didn't end up anywhere good. Followed her last known pings and found her here, caught in this glitchy limbo. Phasing in and out. In and out.\rElon Serene: What’s wrong with her?\rUnironic Ken: Looks like she got d-mezzed. But she's stuck somewhere between here and the Waste Land! respawn node.\rTerra from Vader: But that’s horrible. The pain of getting d-mezzed...\rUnironic Ken: I can't say for sure if she's experiencing it repeatedly. If she is...damn, that's a rough ride. Being d-mezzed...that’s a kind of pain that makes getting your Inventory burned look like a minor inconvenience.\rTerra from Vader: I’d even take the respawn sickness over the hell she’s stuck in any cirxit.\rElon Serene: Is this related to the payload? This...strange temporal echo?\rUnironic Ken: The time loop, the misplaced NPCs...I don't know, they could all have something to do with the payload, whatever it is. Maybe it’s so powerful it can mess with pre-programmed Paradigm stuff. According to our Hackers, this payload is a massive chunk of data, with its claws deep in the code of the Beta Worlds, so it's possible it could be altering things. Trouble is we don’t have access to the actual data it holds. But none of that helps with how to sort out Ziva here.\rTerra from Vader: Can’t we just, ya know, run her through? Finish the d-mezz for her?\rUnironic Ken: Her HP meter is already at zero. Her Inventory has already been burned. She is d-mezzed in every sense of the word. But for whatever twisted reason, she's not popping up at the respawn node.\rElon Serene: Maybe my leftover Sewer Scone will help her.\rUnironic Ken: Your Sewer Scone?\rElon Serene: Sorry, was that joke in bad taste? Too soon? You see, I never was good with the heavy stuff-\rUnironic Ken: You mean to tell me you waltzed through the Gamma Gutters without eating your RADtions?\rElon Serene: RADtions?\rUnironic Ken: The Scone, man! You need to eat the Scone to get through Gamma Gutters. It's all part of the riddle, you numbskull. “Claim your prize swiftly, lest your fortune devolves. Now awaits the true test of resolve.”\rTerra from Vader: And if he didn't?\rUnironic Ken: If you don’t eat the Scone, you're not supposed to get through Gamma Gutters in one piece. That's what the Gunkgorger is for.\rTerra from Vader: I'm pretty sure we would remember something called the Gunkgorger.\rUnironic Ken: Power levels off the charts. Sneaks up and hauls you into the sewage. Between the rads and its attack tactics, you're pixels in a matter of tix. The only way out of Gamma Gutters is that Sewer Scone - it won't touch you if you've had it.\rElon Serene: Well, Terra did have hers, maybe that's why...\rUnironic Ken: Nope, nope. That doesn't track either. It's a per-Broker thing.\rTerra from Vader: Hold on, what’s that rank smell?\rElon Serene: Ugh, nasty. Smells just like-\rUnironic Ken: Run.\rTerra from Vader: Wait, it does smell like the sewers.\rUnironic Ken: Stop sniffing and start hauling ass, you noobs! MOVE IT!\rSKLURRRGGG\rElon Serene: WHAT IS THAT THING?\rUnironic Ken: THE FUCKING GUNKGORGER!\rTerra from Vader: I THOUGHT YOU SAID IT WAS IN THE GAMMA GUTTERS ZONE!\rUnironic Ken: IT’S SUPPOSED TO BE!\rSLAAARRRP\rElon Serene: Where are we heading?\rUnironic Ken: The tunnels will take us straight to the respawn node. Our best bet is to reach the Safe Zone at the initial respawn point before Gunkgorger here d-mezzes us, and we potentially end up like poor Ziva.\rTerra from Vader: And what's the deal with the respawn node in Waste Land!? I'm guessing it's not as simple as the Era Novum node, where all you have to deal with is a mind-numbing stack of paperwork.\rUnironic Ken: It’s an abandoned nuclear power plant. This tunnel will lead us straight underneath it, through a secret entrance. Once we're in, it's an all-out sprint to reach the control room where the initial respawn point is located.\rElon Serene: What’s the catch? Every respawn node has a catch!\rUnironic Ken: Getting back through Fallout Fields is the catch! Damn, and I thought you were the Gunter. Those rad storms that constantly reshape the environment every few hours? They turn this place into a twisted, never-ending obstacle course.\rElon Serene: How much-\rUnironic Ken: No time for questions, up the ladder!\rTerra from Vader: Guyyyyyyyys, it’s gaining on us. Climb faster!\rElon Serene: Which way to the control room? Where's the Safe Zone?\rUnironic Ken: Follow me, you grunts. This way! A few…more…meters. I’ve got the door-\rSLAAARRGGG\rUnironic Ken: GET TO THE SAFE ZONE!\rElon Serene: Terra! No!\rTerra from Vader: Oh, fu-"
